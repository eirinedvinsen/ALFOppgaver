            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>
                At Cat’s Cradle Business, we believe life is too short for boring yarn. That’s why we’ve dedicated ourselves to crafting premium, paw-approved yarn for the world’s most discerning clientele: cats.
                <br>
                Our journey began when our founder, Chairman Meow, batted a ball of discount yarn across the boardroom floor and declared, “This simply will not do.” Since then, we’ve committed to sourcing only the finest, fluffiest, and most chaseable yarns—meticulously tested by our in-house panel of feline experts (who are paid exclusively in treats and head scratches).
                <br>
                We don’t just sell yarn. We sell dreams. Tangled dreams. Dreams that roll under the couch and mysteriously disappear until 3 a.m. when your cat decides it’s time for a surprise performance.
                <br>
                At Cat’s Cradle, every strand tells a story. A story of luxury, elegance, and just the right amount of chaos.
                <br>
                Because your cat doesn’t deserve just any yarn—
                <br><br>
                they deserve the best yarn of their nine lives.</p>
